# MemoryOS Implementation Plan

## Notes

- The implementation will follow the strategy outlined in `docs/implementation_strategy.md`.
- Per user request, a copy of this plan will be maintained at `docs/development_plan.md`.
- The system is designed as an Ash domain (`MemoryOS`) with a hierarchical memory structure (STM, MTM, LPM, SystemMemory).
- Configuration will be handled both globally in `config.exs` and on a per-agent basis via a `MemoryOS.Configuration` resource.
- Background jobs for memory management will be handled by Oban.
- LLM interactions are abstracted through a dedicated `MemoryOS.LLMClient` module, to be integrated with `AshAI`.
- The project is a standard Phoenix application with core logic in `lib/smith`.
- No existing Ash domains were found. The new `MemoryOS` domain will be created in `lib/smith/memory_os`, establishing the pattern for Ash-based modules in the project.
- `ash_oban` has been installed and configured using `mix igniter.install ash_oban`. A migration has been generated.
- The project was facing compilation errors related to the `calculations` DSL in `DialogueSegment`. This has been fixed. The next step is to re-compile and check for further errors.
